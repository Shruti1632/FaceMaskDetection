# FaceMaskDetectionðŸ˜·
This project introduces a real-time Facial Mask Recognition system leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect and categorize individuals based on their mask-wearing status. The system addresses the increasing demand for automated solutions in enforcing mask-wearing protocols to mitigate the spread of infectious diseases. The CNN model is trained on a diverse dataset encompassing variations in pose, lighting conditions, and mask types, enabling it to differentiate between individuals wearing masks correctly, those without masks, and potentially those with improperly worn masks.

Operational in settings such as airports, public transportation, and healthcare facilities, the system utilizes computer vision techniques for face detection and localization. Its user-friendly interface facilitates seamless deployment. Performance evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, ensuring robustness in practical applications by accommodating various mask styles, facial expressions, and environmental conditions.

The results highlight the program's efficacy in accurately identifying individuals based on their mask-wearing status. The implementation of this system has significant potential to enhance public health and safety measures by automating the monitoring of mask compliance across diverse public spaces. This innovative solution addresses the critical role of face masks in the ongoing global health crisis, providing a reliable and efficient means of enforcing adherence to mask protocols.
